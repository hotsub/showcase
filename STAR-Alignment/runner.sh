# Hi, this is a note for `hotsub` users.
# This script is an example to run STAR RNA-seq alignment.
# The following command definitely represents how `hotsub` works.
# You might need to customize 2 things
#     1. The location of sample file described in CSV file.
#     2. The location of reference files specified by `--shared` flag.
#     3. IAM instance profile that you have.
# and you can have this example working for your own samples.
# Good luck!
